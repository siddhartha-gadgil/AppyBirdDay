AppyBirdDay: Identifying Indian Birds

This is an application to recognize Indian Birds based on 

* How well the description matches that of the bird (allowing for some errors).
* How common the bird is. 

As of now the code has not been tuned. The code is in **Dart** at the Browser end and **scala** using the play framework at the server end, using **mongodb** for the data.
